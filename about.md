Welcome to my little Github blog. My plan is to write about simple data analysis and visualization methods. I expect the focus to be on neuroimaging, but there may be other topics from time to time.

The main reason for doing this is that the internet has helped me out a great deal in my work. This is my attempt to give something back.
