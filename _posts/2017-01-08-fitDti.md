One of the great things about neuroimaging is the variety of [great](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/) [software](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki) [packages](https://www.nitrc.org/) for analyzing data. These packages make it fairly easy to perform highly sophisticated and informative analyses. However, the ease of use of these packages does have tend to   seperate the user from the actual computations that take place. While I don't think it necessary for the user to understand every computational detail - I certainly don't - I do think it is important to understand the basics. 

Take, for example, [diffusion weighted imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_MRI) (DWI). DWI measures the diffusion of water thoughout the brain, and is used to examine white matter structure. Perhaps the most common model that is used for the analysis of DWI data is the [diffusion tensor model](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2041910/), which  represents the diffusion of water as a 3D ellipsoid. In white matter the diffusion tensor tends to be highly [anisotropic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisotropy) as flow occurs primarily along the axon. A useful way of quantifying anisotropy is [fractional anisotrophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractional_anisotropy):

\\[ \sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\frac{\sqrt{5}}{3} \\]
